personal fork of surf with the following features

  > -l option to set the window class
  > no default font size set (setting it causes buggy font sizing)
  > gpu acceleration always enabled (makes browsing smoother)
  > clicking on links calls xdg-open instead of spawning a new surf window. this allows you to
    wrap surf in a script that sends new windows to a specific tabbed instance. see the tsurf script
  > default config dir relocated to ~/.config/surf
  > non-urls are recognized and searched on duckduckgo
  > keeps track of all the url's you visit and shows them in the url menu ordered by frequency.
    works best with my dmenu fork https://github.com/Francesco149/dmenu
  > map MOD + SHIFT + U/Y to scroll horizontally
  > remap MOD + U/D to page up/down
  > copy/paste to/from clipboard, not primary selection

surf - simple webkit-based browser
==================================
surf is a simple Web browser based on WebKit/GTK+.

Requirements
------------
In order to build surf you need GTK+ and Webkit/GTK+ header files.

In order to use the functionality of the url-bar, also install dmenu[0].

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (surf is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install surf (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

Running surf
------------
run
	surf [URI]

See the manpage for further options.

Running surf in tabbed
----------------------
For running surf in tabbed[1] there is a script included in the distribution,
which is run like this:

	surf-open.sh [URI]

Further invocations of the script will run surf with the specified URI in this
instance of tabbed.
